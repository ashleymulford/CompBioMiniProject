#1 Download data: click on links in pdfs, will take you to NCBI, scroll down then click on the ID under Run, 
   will take you SRA page, click data access, copy link 2 and download run with wget - do for all four
   
#2 Python code to make input - fasta file
      output fasta file and log file
   build index with kallisto using fasta file
   kallisto index -i hcmv_index.idx HCMV_reads.fasta

#3 Quantify the TPM of each CDS using kallisto (do for each SRR)
   kallisto quant -i hcmv_index.idx -o quant_results_SRR5660030 -b 30 -t 4 SRR5660030.1_1.fastq SRR5660030.1_2.fastq
   Generates input for sleuth (R) - find differentially expressed genes between the two timepoints (2pi and 6dpi)
